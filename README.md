## Introduction

- Schedo stands for Scheduler + Todo list app.
- We often forget the tasks we think of doing. But what if you want write about tasks that are not urgent but important?
- Using this app you can schedule your tasks for any coming day. It also gives you todo interface to tick things off.

- Enter the task you want to do, set a date for it and click create.

## Technology

- This is made with React.
- Right now it uses localStorage (browser storage) to store the list, I plan to expand it further and introduce storage to this.

## Installing-locally

- Just clone or download the repo directly.
- cd into frontend directory and use `npm run dev` to start the application.

## Future-plans

There are a bunch of ideas in the list.

- There will be animations when scheduling.
- There will be alerts when a task is due.
- We can also include time along with date as due time for the task.
- The UI will get better.
  ... and many more to come
